On friday, in the need of sweet and hot wein and some food, half dozen of KDE guys took over the Nürnberger Weihnachtsmarkt.

The night was followed by Dunkel Bier and a darts deathmatch. No surprise I won so fast that nobody let my play anymore. Coolo is satisfied with a 2nd place. Dirk still can't get under 500 points (you start with 501). Will used the Royal Air Force superpowers to get rid of the points, but some random luck worked better. The girl sitting next to the target still has nightmares about Beineri throwing darts to her. It was a fun night.

The night ended with Whiskey at Will's place. More pictures [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/duncanmac-vicar/sets/1515864/)
