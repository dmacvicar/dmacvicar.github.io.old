It has been long time since I blogged. Mostly because I was not at home and when I was I did not feel like doing something in the computer other than listening music.

I had to do a quick visit to the States because work, and then my brother came from Paris to my place to spend Christmas together. I showed him NÃ¼rnberg and then quick trips to Prag (my 2nd time, and the third is coming...) and Berlin for new year.
